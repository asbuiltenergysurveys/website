                    Acoustic or sound insulation testing is undertaken on newly built or buildings undergoing renovation to ascertain the level of sound insulation in certain building elements. The test measures the amount of sound which can pass through these elements and indicates if the level is acceptable to neighbours adjoining the property being tested.
