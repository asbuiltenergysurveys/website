                    Air Tightness is the resistance of the building envelope to inward or outward air leakage. Excessive air leakage results in increased energy consumption and a draughty, cold building.

                <p>
                    Air leakage is driven by differential pressures across the building envelope. The mechanisms that create these differences in pressure are the combined effects of:

                    <li>
                        Stack (internal warm air rises)
                    </li>
                    <li>External wind (inducing +ve and –ve pressures on the envelope)</li>
                    <li>Mechanical ventilation systems</li>
                </ul>
